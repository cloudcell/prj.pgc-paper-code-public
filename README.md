### Running the Example
```
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./.venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ./.venv/bin/activate

# Generate the sample Dataset
# (Warning - you need ~20GB of RAM free for this)
python3 text_to_binary_dataset.py

# Run the training
python 273_addressing_txt.py
```
